## I have a bugfix/small documentation change. How do i contribute?

1. Open a PR on [github](https://github.com/micziz/pyblocks/pulls)
2. Make sure you are on the correct branch. All pr's go to develop, and are then slowly merged into the master branch as time goes by.
3. Make a descriptive title/description. If we don't understand it, than how are we gonna merge it?
4. KISS Keep It Simple Stupid. Don't over engineer it.
5. Once you are ready, open the pr. Someone on the team will respond in a timeley manner, and will then merge your contributions.
